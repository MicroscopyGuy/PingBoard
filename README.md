**What does it do?**
PingBoard is a monitoring application that sends out pings to a specified IPAddress or domain 
for real-time tracking of network conditions on an informative dashboard.  Later on, it will also support functionality 
such as Traceroute and Dns resolution.


**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: C# / ASP.NET Core 
- Database: Sqlite / EF Core
- FrontEnd: Typescript / Javascript / ReactJS
- Desktop Application Framework: Electron


**Why make this?**
This project is the third iteration of a project I created during the Covid Pandemic to quantify network issues
I was having. Starting in March of 2024, I began to flesh it out into a full-fledged desktop application to
get some exposure to some new technologies and crucially, create a product I was proud of and wanted to share for free.


**What is the benefit of this vs other already available solutions that do the same thing?**
The most ubiquitous programs that already do this are ones such as SmokePing and PingPlotter, and they are fantastic.
While SmokePing is free, it is *extremely* configurable and has so many options, and I wanted to make a thinner and more focused
tool. I have used PingPlotter for a while, but the free option is quite limited, offering only a 10 minute lookback time.

PingBoard is free, open source, and allows storage of as much data as your local storage will allow.


**When can I try it?**
I am working hard and hope to have a beta version available to try in the next few weeks, once I have 
done some more work on the Frontend to support what I have recently added to the Backend.


I'm very excited about this project, and I look forward to sharing updates here when they are available!
